          We are living in a would that tell us how we should and shouldnâ€™t be,
          gives tips and advice, guides how to be successful and happy. It seems
          like there is only that one right path and you just have to step on
          it.

        <MissionTextAttention>That is NOT true.</MissionTextAttention>
        <p>
          What is right for your neighbour is not automatically right for you.
          It is so much easier if there would be a recipe for happiness and the
          world pretends there is one. And we look into the world to find
          inspiration but more often than not it turns into confusion and a loss
          of the connection to yourself.
